Common solving techniques:
1. Flattening a tree with euler tour, and then matching every subtree with an interval on the segment tree.
2. Storing more than one value in each node.
3. Walking on the segment tree (ex. first position with value > x)
4. Compressing segment tree with sorting
5, Ordered set on each node

More segment trees:
1. Lazy segment tree (RURQ)
2. 2D segment tree
3. Compressed 2D segment tree
4. Sparse segment tree
5. Persistent segment trees

Applications (variou queries):
1. Distinct value queries
2. Polynomial updates
3. K-th smallest element in the range [l, r]
4. Closest element greater than x

Other applications:
1. LIS
2. Line sweep
3. Heavy light decomposition
4. LCA with sparse table
