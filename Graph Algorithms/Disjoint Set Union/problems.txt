Q1. Size of components
A1. Just set up another array size[] that represents the size of a component. 
    Generally, if there are more properties, just set up more arrays. But be careful of the initial values.


A lot of DSU problems have to do with sorting of the edges. (ex. usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=384).
Kruskal's algorithm also uses this technique.
