Q1. Size of components
A1. Just set up another array size[] that represents the size of a component. 
    Generally, if there are more properties, just set up more arrays. But be careful of the initial values.

Q2. Finding the number of holes in a each component
xxx
x.x
xxx

A2. Assuming the values on the border of the holes is higher than the inside, we can sort the cells.
    Then we do 2 DSUs, the first one in increasing order so the holes are processed first
    The second one in decreasing order. We have to match the results of the 2 DSUs to figure out the answer (USACO valleys)
    


Common solving techniques:
1. A lot of DSU problems have to do with sorting of the edges. (ex. usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=384).
   Kruskal's algorithm also uses this technique.
2. Small to large merging might be used when combining components
3. Deleting nodes one by one --> adding nodes one by one.
